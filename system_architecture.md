## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive system architecture for a grocery price comparison platform targeting Ontario families. The platform enables users to search for products across multiple grocery chains by entering their postal code, providing real-time price comparisons through a combination of web scraping and flyer data aggregation.

The architecture follows modern microservices principles with a clear separation between frontend presentation, backend API services, data collection pipelines, and storage layers. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and high availability while ensuring compliance with web scraping best practices and data privacy regulations.

## System Overview

### Core Objectives

The grocery price comparison platform addresses several key market needs in the Canadian retail grocery sector. Primary objectives include providing consumers with transparent pricing information across major grocery chains, reducing the time and effort required for price comparison shopping, and creating a centralized platform for deal discovery and savings optimization.

The system architecture supports these objectives through a distributed design that separates concerns between user interface, business logic, data collection, and storage. This separation enables independent scaling of components based on demand patterns, with the data collection layer operating on different schedules than the user-facing components.

### High-Level Architecture

The platform follows a three-tier architecture pattern with additional specialized components for data collection and processing. The presentation tier consists of a React-based single-page application optimized for mobile devices. The application tier includes FastAPI-based microservices handling user requests, product searches, and price comparisons. The data tier encompasses PostgreSQL databases for structured data storage and Redis for caching frequently accessed information.

Data collection operates as a separate pipeline using Scrapy-based web crawlers that extract product and pricing information from grocery store websites and digital flyers. This pipeline runs on scheduled intervals to ensure data freshness while respecting rate limits and terms of service for target websites.

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Frontend Technology Selection

React was selected as the primary frontend framework based on several technical and strategic considerations. React's component-based architecture aligns well with the modular design requirements of a price comparison interface, where product cards, store listings, and search components need to be reusable and maintainable.

The virtual DOM implementation in React provides performance benefits crucial for mobile users who may have limited processing power and network connectivity. Given that over 70% of grocery shopping research occurs on mobile devices, optimizing for mobile performance is essential for user adoption and retention.

Tailwind CSS complements React by providing utility-first styling that enables rapid development of responsive interfaces. The framework's mobile-first approach aligns with the platform's target audience, and its small bundle size contributes to faster page load times. Tailwind's design system approach also ensures visual consistency across components while allowing for customization as the platform evolves.

### Backend Architecture Decisions

FastAPI was chosen for the backend API layer due to its modern Python architecture and built-in support for asynchronous operations. The grocery price comparison use case involves multiple concurrent database queries and external API calls, making async support essential for maintaining responsive user experiences under load.

FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI documentation generation provides significant development velocity benefits, enabling frontend developers to understand and integrate with API endpoints more efficiently. The framework's built-in data validation using Pydantic models reduces the likelihood of data consistency issues between frontend and backend components.

Python's extensive ecosystem for data processing and machine learning libraries supports the product matching and normalization requirements. Libraries such as spaCy for natural language processing, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for similarity algorithms integrate seamlessly with the FastAPI backend.

### Database Design Philosophy

PostgreSQL serves as the primary database due to its robust support for complex queries, full-text search capabilities, and JSON data types. The grocery price comparison domain involves semi-structured data where product attributes may vary significantly between stores and categories.

PostgreSQL's full-text search features enable efficient product name matching and search functionality without requiring additional search infrastructure. The database's support for partial indexes and materialized views optimizes query performance for frequently accessed price comparison data.

Redis provides caching for frequently requested price comparisons and search results. Given that users often search for common products like milk, bread, and eggs, caching these results reduces database load and improves response times. Redis also supports session storage for user preferences and recent searches.

### Data Collection Infrastructure

Scrapy was selected for web scraping operations due to its robust handling of concurrent requests, built-in support for handling JavaScript-rendered content, and extensive middleware ecosystem for managing rate limiting and proxy rotation.

The scraping infrastructure operates independently from the user-facing application, running on scheduled intervals to collect fresh pricing data. This separation ensures that scraping operations do not impact user experience and allows for different scaling strategies based on data collection requirements versus user traffic patterns.

Scrapy's pipeline architecture enables data validation, deduplication, and normalization during the collection process. Custom pipelines handle product matching, price validation, and store location mapping before data reaches the primary database.

## Detailed Component Architecture

### Frontend Application Structure

The React application follows a feature-based directory structure that organizes components, hooks, and utilities by business domain rather than technical function. This approach improves maintainability as the application grows and enables teams to work on features independently.

The application state management utilizes React's built-in Context API for global state such as user location and search preferences, while local component state handles form inputs and UI interactions. This hybrid approach avoids the complexity of external state management libraries while providing sufficient state coordination for the application's requirements.

Custom hooks encapsulate business logic for postal code validation, product search, and price comparison display. These hooks abstract API interactions and provide consistent interfaces for components, enabling easier testing and code reuse across different parts of the application.

### API Service Architecture

The backend API follows RESTful design principles with clear resource-based endpoints for stores, products, and price comparisons. The API structure supports both synchronous requests for immediate data retrieval and asynchronous operations for complex price analysis tasks.

Authentication and authorization utilize JWT tokens for stateless session management, enabling horizontal scaling of API services without session affinity requirements. The token-based approach also supports future mobile application development and third-party integrations.

Rate limiting protects the API from abuse while ensuring fair access for legitimate users. The implementation uses sliding window algorithms to provide smooth rate limiting that accommodates burst traffic patterns common in grocery shopping applications.

### Data Processing Pipeline

The data collection pipeline operates on a multi-stage architecture that separates crawling, extraction, validation, and storage operations. This separation enables independent scaling and monitoring of each stage while providing clear failure isolation and recovery mechanisms.

Crawling operations target grocery store websites and digital flyer platforms on configurable schedules that respect each site's terms of service and technical limitations. The crawler maintains politeness policies that include request delays, concurrent connection limits, and user agent rotation.

Data extraction transforms raw HTML and PDF content into structured product and pricing information. This stage handles the significant variation in data formats across different grocery chains, normalizing product names, prices, units, and promotional information into consistent schemas.

Validation ensures data quality through multiple checks including price reasonableness, product category consistency, and temporal validation for promotional periods. Invalid data is flagged for manual review while valid data proceeds to the normalization stage.

## Database Schema Design

### Core Entity Relationships

The database schema centers around four primary entities: Stores, Products, Prices, and Locations. This normalized design reduces data redundancy while supporting efficient queries for price comparisons and product searches.

The Store entity contains information about grocery chain locations including name, address, postal code, and operating hours. Each store links to a parent chain entity that maintains brand-level information such as logos, corporate policies, and regional coverage areas.

Products are modeled with flexible attributes to accommodate the wide variation in grocery items. The schema includes normalized fields for common attributes like brand, size, and category, while supporting additional attributes through JSON fields for chain-specific or category-specific information.

The Price entity creates time-series records linking products to stores with temporal validity periods. This design supports price history tracking and promotional period management while enabling efficient queries for current pricing information.

### Indexing Strategy

Database indexes are strategically designed to optimize the most common query patterns in grocery price comparison scenarios. Composite indexes on postal code and product category enable efficient location-based product searches, while partial indexes on current prices reduce index size and improve update performance.

Full-text search indexes on product names and descriptions support fuzzy matching and autocomplete functionality. These indexes utilize PostgreSQL's built-in text search capabilities with custom dictionaries for grocery-specific terminology and brand name variations.

Temporal indexes on price validity periods enable efficient queries for current and historical pricing information. The indexing strategy balances query performance with storage efficiency, particularly important given the high volume of price update operations.

### Data Partitioning Considerations

The database design anticipates future scaling requirements through logical partitioning strategies that can be implemented as data volumes grow. Price data partitioning by time periods enables efficient archival of historical data while maintaining query performance for current information.

Geographic partitioning by province or region supports expansion beyond Ontario while maintaining query locality for location-based searches. This approach also enables compliance with provincial data residency requirements that may apply to consumer pricing information.

## Integration Architecture

### External Service Dependencies

The platform integrates with several external services to provide comprehensive functionality. Google Maps API or Geocodio services handle postal code to geographic coordinate conversion, enabling distance-based store filtering and mapping functionality.

Email services support user notifications for price alerts and promotional updates. The integration uses template-based email generation with personalization based on user preferences and search history.

Payment processing integration prepares for future monetization through premium features or affiliate partnerships with grocery chains. The architecture maintains separation between core functionality and payment processing to ensure platform availability independent of payment service status.

### API Design Principles

The platform's API follows OpenAPI 3.0 specifications with comprehensive documentation and example requests for all endpoints. This approach supports frontend development, third-party integrations, and future mobile application development.

Error handling utilizes standardized HTTP status codes with detailed error messages that provide actionable information for client applications. The API maintains backward compatibility through versioning strategies that enable gradual migration of client applications.

Response caching headers optimize client-side caching while ensuring data freshness for price-sensitive information. The caching strategy balances performance with accuracy requirements specific to grocery pricing data.

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection Measures

The platform implements comprehensive data protection measures addressing both user privacy and business data security. User location data is processed with minimal retention policies, storing only aggregated postal code areas rather than specific addresses.

Database encryption protects sensitive information both at rest and in transit. Connection encryption uses TLS 1.3 for all external communications, while database-level encryption protects stored pricing and user preference data.

Access control follows principle of least privilege with role-based permissions for different system components. Administrative access requires multi-factor authentication and maintains comprehensive audit logs for compliance and security monitoring.

### Web Scraping Compliance

The data collection infrastructure implements ethical web scraping practices that respect website terms of service and technical limitations. Rate limiting ensures that scraping operations do not impact target website performance or availability.

User agent identification clearly identifies the platform's scraping activities with contact information for website administrators. The scraping infrastructure respects robots.txt files and implements exponential backoff for rate-limited requests.

Data attribution maintains clear source tracking for all collected pricing information, enabling compliance with attribution requirements and supporting data quality validation processes.

## Performance and Scalability

### Caching Strategy

The platform implements multi-layer caching to optimize performance across different usage patterns. Browser-level caching handles static assets and infrequently changing content such as store information and product categories.

Application-level caching using Redis stores frequently requested price comparisons and search results. The caching strategy implements intelligent invalidation based on data freshness requirements, with shorter cache periods for promotional pricing and longer periods for stable product information.

Database query caching optimizes repeated searches for popular products and common postal code areas. Materialized views pre-compute complex price comparison queries for high-traffic scenarios while maintaining data consistency through scheduled refresh operations.

### Horizontal Scaling Design

The microservices architecture enables independent scaling of different system components based on demand patterns. Frontend applications can be distributed through content delivery networks to reduce latency for users across Ontario.

API services support horizontal scaling through stateless design and load balancer distribution. Database read replicas handle query-heavy operations while maintaining write consistency through primary database instances.

The data collection pipeline scales independently through distributed crawling operations that can be deployed across multiple servers or cloud regions based on target website geographic distribution and rate limiting requirements.

### Performance Monitoring

Comprehensive monitoring tracks system performance across all architectural layers. Application performance monitoring captures response times, error rates, and user experience metrics that directly impact platform adoption and retention.

Database performance monitoring identifies slow queries and optimization opportunities, particularly important given the complex price comparison queries that span multiple stores and product categories.

Infrastructure monitoring tracks resource utilization and scaling triggers, enabling proactive capacity management during peak usage periods such as weekend grocery shopping times.

## Deployment Architecture

### Cloud Infrastructure Strategy

The platform utilizes cloud-native deployment strategies that provide scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency. Frontend applications deploy to Vercel for global content distribution and automatic scaling based on traffic patterns.

Backend services deploy to containerized environments using Docker and Kubernetes orchestration. This approach provides consistent deployment environments across development, staging, and production while enabling efficient resource utilization and automatic scaling.

Database services utilize managed cloud providers such as AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL to ensure high availability, automated backups, and professional database administration without internal infrastructure management overhead.
